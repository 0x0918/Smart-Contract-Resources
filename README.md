## Dictionary of Key Terms (Solidity) 
 `Aave` - decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers. Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralised (perpetually) or undercollateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion; Stani Kulechov [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA9QrrH-ze0) by Haseeb Qureshi   

`ABI` - application binary interface specifies set of functions that can be accessed outside of smart contract; similar to a JSON  

`address` - (Ethereum; other blockchains will be different) a 42-character hexadecimal address derived from the last 20 bytes of the public key controlling the account with 0x appended in front `0x0cE446255506E92DF41614C46F1d6df9Cc969183`      

`AMM` - Automated Market Maker; underlying protocol that powers all decentralized exchanges (DEXs), DEXs help users exchange cryptocurrencies by connecting users directly, without an intermediary; autonomous trading mechanisms that eliminate the need for centralized exchanges   

`arrays` - **fixed** [2] length of 2 elements and **dynamic** [] arrays with no fixed size; can also create an **array of structs**  

`assertEQ`   

`bridges` - Crosschain Transactions and [Bridges](https://blog.makerdao.com/what-are-blockchain-bridges-and-why-are-they-important-for-defi/): and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJyEJVaXMNo&t=4979s)    

`dark forest` - “all people with nodes on major blockchains grinding on mempool transactions” - 9:40 [Andrew Miller AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwRfEsX07MU) and later mentions [David Chaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum)      

`constant` - naming convention ALL_CAPS; more `gas efficient`   

`constructor` - called once when contract is deployed   

`custom errors` - declared at top, more `gas efficient`    

`data Locations` - Storage, Memory and Calldata
  1. storage - variable is a state variable (store on blockchain)
  2. memory - variable is in memory and it exists while a function is being called
  3. calldata - special data location that contains function arguments    
  
`enums` - useful to model choice and keep track of state/can be declared outside of a contract    

`events` - allow logging to the Ethereum blockchain; Use cases for events are: Listening for events and updating user interface; cheap form of storage   

`fallback` - special function executed either when a function that does not exist is called or Ether is sent directly to a contract but receive() does not exist or msg.data is not empty; fallback has a 2300 gas limit when called by transfer or send   

`fuzzing` -    

`gas` - transactions with higher gas price have higher priority to be included in a block;   

`immutable` - can be set inside the constructor but cannot be modified afterwards, more `gas efficient`: `i_owner` - i meaning immutable   

`invariant` -    

`Keccak256` - [SHA-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3)/Secure Hash Algorithm; using it in a [contract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCD3fOlsGc4)   

`memepool` - or [memory pool](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-mempool) is a dynamic staging area in front of the blockchain that enables transaction ordering, fee prioritization, and general block construction; a list of pending transactions waiting for validation from a node before it is committed to a block on the blockchain   

`EV` - maximal (formerly miner) extractable value; referred to as an “invisible tax” that miners can collect from users – essentially, the maximum value a miner can extract from moving around transactions when producing a block on a blockchain network   

`modifier` - `_;` underscore proceeds with code; code that can be run before and/or after a function call
  1. Restrict access
  2. Validate inputs
  3. Guard against reentrancy hack   
  
`Nonce` - transaction code for this account starting with 0  

`oracle` - entities that connect blockchains to external systems, thereby enabling smart contracts to execute based upon inputs and outputs from the real world; a way for the decentralized ecosystem to access existing data sources, legacy systems, and advanced computations (blockchain middleware); also `oracle manipulation` via flash loans etc...   

`proof of concept` - piece of code that demonstrates the vulnerability is exploitable; 100Proof's [sample](https://github.com/one-hundred-proof/notional-flash-attack)  

`private functions` - it's convention to start private function names with an underscore (_): 
```
function _functionname() private {}   
```

`private relay` - "flash bots protect; no one sees transaction and can't front run it" per 32:50 of [Dan Robinson AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz7g0ny99jk)   

`pure` - static, does not effect or modify state, more computational [free function]   

`recieve` -   

`require` -   

`revert` - gives back gas but loses some   

`Solc` - the solidity compiler to byte code    

`slippage` - ??   

`smart contract` - programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met; a transaction protocol intended to automatically execute, control or document events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement      

`state variables` - variables stored permanently on the blockchain   

`struct` - useful for grouping related data, can be declared outside of a contract and imported in another contract    

`TVL` - total value locked: includes all coins deposited in all functions that protocol offers: Staking, Lending, Liquidity pools   

`unchecked` - instead of `SafeMath` can be more `gas efficient` if you know your math won’t reach top or bottom limits   

`Uniswap` - decentralized cryptocurrency [exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniswap) that uses a set of smart contracts (liquidity pools) to execute trades on its exchange  [whitepaper](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf)

## Gas Optimization
A transaction costs a base of 21,000 gas   
each computational step cost ~2-10 gas (usually)   
each byte of data costs 16 gas (4 if zero byte)   
editing a storage slot costs 5,000 gas (20,000 if not yet filled)   

- Strings, arrays, and loops are `computationally expensive`   
- `custom errors` - declared at top, more `gas efficient`   
- `constant` - naming convention ALL_CAPS; more `gas efficient`    
- `immutable` - can be set inside the constructor but cannot be modified after, more `gas efficient`: `i_owner`, i meaning immutable    
- batch minting

## Tokens
* ERC-20 - Token contract for fungible assets.
* ERC-721 - Token standard for non-fungible assets.
* ERC-1155 - Multi Token Standard to take the best from previous standards to create a fungibility-agnostic and gas-efficient token contract.
* ERC-918 - Mineable Token Standard.
* ERC-165 - Creates a standard method to publish and detect what interfaces a smart contract implements.
* ERC-725 - A standard interface for a simple proxy account.
* ERC-173 - A standard interface for ownership of contracts.

## Audits
`What is an audit?` - security focused code review; looking for vulnerabilities; it is a best effort endeavor, not a guarantee
