 `Aave` - decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers. Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralised (perpetually) or undercollateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion; Stani Kulechov [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA9QrrH-ze0) by Haseeb Qureshi -- [Aave website](https://app.aave.com/)    

`ABI` - application binary interface specifies set of functions that can be accessed outside of smart contract; similar to a JSON

`blob` - binary large object is a collection of data of an arbitrary size. Blobs do not have to follow a given format or have any metadata associated with them. They are a series of bytes, with each byte made up of 8 bits (a 1 or a 0, hence the "binary" descriptor). Any type of data can go in a blob; efficient and cheap transaction.   

`block.timestamp` - convert a uint of the number of seconds in that length of time. So 1 minutes is 60, 1 hours is 3600 (60 seconds x 60 minutes), 1 days is 86400 (24 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds), find on [cheatsheet](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/cheatsheet.html)

`Howey Test` - refers to the U.S. Supreme Court [case](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp) for determining whether a transaction qualifies as an "investment contract," and therefore would be considered a security; (per Infinite Machine Chp. White-Shoe Lawyers) Ether presale was classified as a utility, a function of ethereum and therefore not a security; manner distribution of a product and not as a speculative investment; essentially a utility token   

`immutable` - can be set inside the constructor but cannot be modified afterwards, more `gas efficient`: `i_owner` - i meaning immutable   

`impermanent loss` - a temporary loss of funds occurring when providing liquidity; occurs when the mathematical formula adjusts the asset ratio in a pool to ensure they remain at 50:50 in terms of value and the liquidity provider loses out on gains from a deposited asset that outperforms; [whiteboard crypto video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m6Mowq3Ptk)

`Nick Szabo` - [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) coined the phrase and concept of "smart contracts"   

`node` - blockchains are decentralized, immutable, digital ledgers shared across a peer-to-peer network. Acting as a database, transaction data is permanently recorded, stored and encrypted onto the “blocks” that are then “chained” together. The physical, electronic devices (a computer, typically) that maintain copies of the chains webbing a network together, keeping the blockchain operational, are called [nodes](https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-node) 
- lightweight nodes - are downloaded wallets connected to full nodes for validating the data stored on the blockchain. Simple Payment Verification (SPV) node or lightweight node is used in day-to-day crypto operations.   
  
`nonce` - transaction code for this account starting with 0; makes transactions unique; important regarding concurrency; If the account is an externally owned account, this number represents the number of transactions sent from the account’s address. If the account is a contract account, the nonce is the number of contracts created by the account; [short video](https://youtu.be/EOgpr73-pgc)    

`Omner blocks` - previously Uncle, it's possible for two blocks to be created simultaneously by a network. When this happens, one block will be left out. This leftover block is called an ommer block. In the past, they were called uncle blocks, referring to the familial relationships used to describe block positions within a blockchain  

`Opcode` - operation code; the portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed; see gas [Opcode](https://github.com/crytic/evm-opcodes)   

`oracle` - entities that connect blockchains to external systems, thereby enabling smart contracts to execute based upon inputs and outputs from the real world; a way for the decentralized ecosystem to access existing data sources, legacy systems, and advanced computations (blockchain middleware); also `oracle manipulation` via flash loans etc...   

`ownable` - an [owner](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable) who has special privileges

`remote procedure call` or [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) - when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is written as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly writing the details for the remote interaction   

`self destruct` - leaves a blank account; costs negative gas, does not remove transaction history: only can be self destructed if contract has self destruct programmed in      
`slippage` - the difference between the value of an asset at order placement and the value at order fulfilment. It can be found when buying or selling assets, and can result in either a loss or a gain (higher invariants lead to less slippage; Uniswap)      

`smart contract` - programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met; a transaction protocol intended to automatically execute, control or document events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement; Ethereum contracts are essentially single threaded machine       
- `hybrid smart contracts` - combine code running on the blockchain (on-chain) with data and computation from outside the blockchain (off-chain) provided by decentralized oracle networks. [chainlink](https://chain.link/education-hub/hybrid-smart-contracts)   

`Solc` - the solidity compiler to byte code   

`source lines of code (SLOC)` - software metric used to measure the size of a computer program by counting the number of lines   

`` - before 0.8.0. there were overflow and underflow issues; prior to that version, solidity's "+" operator wouldn't check for overflows, leading to type(uint256).max + 1 = 0, and the safeMath library would avoid it. Now, type(uint256).max + 1 reverts with Panic(0x11), and safeMath isnt needed.

`sybil attack` a [type of attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) on a computer network service in which an attacker subverts the service's reputation system by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence. It is named after the subject of the book Sybil, a case study of a woman diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder; also [sybil resistance](https://www.finder.com.au/blockchain-sybil-resistance-searching-for-the-perfect-waste-of-resources)

`unchecked` - instead of `SafeMath` can be more `gas efficient` if you know your math won’t reach top or bottom limits   

`Uniswap` - decentralized cryptocurrency [exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniswap) that uses a set of smart contracts (liquidity pools) to execute trades on its exchange; [whitepaper](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf) and [billion dollar algorithm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/05/liquidity-mining-on-uniswap-v3) `ticklower` and `tickupper` via [Tick Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/libraries/Tick)    

`UTXO` -  an unspent transaction output (UTXO) represents some amount of digital currency which has been authorized by one account to be spent by another. UTXOs use public key cryptography to identify and transfer ownership between holders of public/private key pairs   

`witness` - [cryptography](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/43462/what-is-a-witness-in-zero-knowledge-proof) solution to puzzle; unspent transaction output, any solution to unlock UTXO; see also [Segregated Witness](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/segwit-segregated-witness.asp)   

`Zcash` - cryptocurrency using zk-SNARKs to provide enhanced privacy; either in a transparent pool or a shielded pool       

`zero address` - contract creation; sometimes sent in an intentional ether burn

`zkSNARK` - succinct non interactive argument of knowledge

## Gas Optimization and Storage
How [storage](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html) works and Patrick Collin's [visual](https://youtu.be/gyMwXuJrbJQ?list=PLQj6KMbjsRt7ft3xEtU8WhkK5-TsxDplY&t=42469) walkthrough and sample contract [FunWithStorage](https://youtu.be/gyMwXuJrbJQ?list=PLQj6KMbjsRt7ft3xEtU8WhkK5-TsxDplY&t=42690)   
Opcodes [Git](https://github.com/crytic/evm-opcodes) and [video](https://youtu.be/M8_4THWJkHQ?t=265)   

Not invented here: meaning the security risk is often greater than improvement value   

A transaction costs a base of 21,000 gas; each computational step costs ~2-10 gas (usually); each byte of data costs 16 gas (4 if zero byte); editing a storage slot costs 5,000 gas (20,000 if not yet filled)    
- check != 0 rather than >    
- `struct packing` - using a smaller-sized uint when possible will allow Solidity to pack these variables together   
- cluster identical data types together     
- strings, arrays, and loops are `computationally expensive`   
- `custom errors` - declared at top, more gas efficient, denoted with `__` two underscores: error FundMe__NotOwner();     
- `constant` - naming convention ALL_CAPS; more `gas efficient`    
- `immutable` - set inside the constructor but cannot be modified after, more `gas efficient`: `i_owner`, i meaning immutable    
- batch minting   
- in testing it's common to prepend storage variables with `s_`
- Hardhat gas reporter

## Hacks and [Security](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/security-considerations.html#pitfalls)
News: [Rekt](https://rekt.news/)   
Vulnerabilities [walkthrough](https://youtu.be/JMf5P2DXfkM)   

Infinite loops and gas limits attacks...   

- Reetrancy - relies on a certain order of operations; a reentrant procedure can be interrupted in the middle of its execution. Following the interruption, the procedure can be called again (“reentered”) before its previous invocations complete execution; exploits “fallback”; A Historical Collection of [Reentrancy Attacks](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/reentrancy-attacks)          
  
- [Sandwich Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26lWg6UIrKw) - a form of front-running and back-running simultaneously, with the original pending transaction sandwiched in between    

- Flash loans  

- [Double spending](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp) - 51% is one of the most commonly cited attacks

- Denial of service (DoS; DDoS attack) 

- Oracle Manipulation - [Awesome-oracle-manipulation](https://github.com/0xcacti/awesome-oracle-manipulation)

- [Replay attack](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/what-is-a-replay-attack/) - a replay of a transaction primarily taken place while a hard fork is being implemented; a delay or intercept data transmission that occurs over a network. This information can then be processed and repeated numerous times to effectively duplicate transactions

### Audits
`What is an audit?` - security focused code review; looking for vulnerabilities; it is a best effort endeavor, not a guarantee    

Most auditor discussions are on Twitter.

Audit Checklist via [The Solcurity Standard](https://github.com/transmissions11/solcurity)   
- Read documentation ReadMe, whitepaper (if avail)  
- check tests, create a notes.MD
- Logical issues: mathematics, floating point arithmetic
- Changing market conditions: tokens; validators, bots…
- Time: does latency allow exploit opportunity?
