## Dictionary of Key Terms   
`ABI` - specifies interface of set of functions that can be accessed outside of smart contract; similar to a JSON interface   
`assertEQ`   
`constant` - naming convention ALL_CAPS; more `gas efficient`   
`constructor` - called once when contract is deployed   
`custom errors` - declared at top, more `gas efficient`    
`data Locations` - Storage, Memory and Calldata
  1. storage - variable is a state variable (store on blockchain)
  2. memory - variable is in memory and it exists while a function is being called
  3. calldata - special data location that contains function arguments    
  
`enums` - useful to model choice and keep track of state/can be declared outside of a contract    
`events` - allow logging to the Ethereum blockchain; Use cases for events are: Listening for events and updating user interface; cheap form of storage   
`fallback` - a special function executed either when a function that does not exist is called or Ether is sent directly to a contract but receive() does not exist or msg.data is not empty; fallback has a 2300 gas limit when called by transfer or send     
`fuzzing` -    
`gas` - transactions with higher gas price have higher priority to be included in a block;   
`immutable` - can be set inside the constructor but cannot be modified afterwards, more `gas efficient`: `i_owner` - i meaning immutable   
`invariant` -    
`Keccak256` - [SHA-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3)/Secure Hash Algorithm; using it in a [contract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCD3fOlsGc4)   
`modifier` - `_;` - the underscore proceeds with code; code that can be run before and/or after a function call
  1. Restrict access
  2. Validate inputs
  3. Guard against reentrancy hack   
  
`Nonce` - transaction code for this account starting with 0  
`Oracle manipulation` -    
`Proof of concept` a piece of code that concretely demonstrates that the vulnerability is exploitable; 100Proof's [sample](https://github.com/one-hundred-proof/notional-flash-attack)  
`pure` - static, does not effect or modify state, more computational [free function]   
`recieve` -   
`require` -   
`revert` - gives back gas but loses some   
`Solc` - the solidity compiler to byte code    
`struct` - useful for grouping together related data, can be declared outside of a contract and imported in another contract     
`TVL` - total value locked: includes all coins deposited in all functions that protocol offers: Staking, Lending, Liquidity pools     
`Unchecked` instead of `SafeMath` can be more `gas efficient` if you know your math won’t reach top or bottom limits

## Gas Optimization
- Strings, arrays, and loops are `computationally expensive`    
-`custom errors` - declared at top, more `gas efficient`   
- `constant` - naming convention ALL_CAPS; more `gas efficient` 
- `immutable` - can be set inside the constructor but cannot be modified afterwards, more `gas efficient`: `i_owner` - i meaning immutable

## Tokens
* ERC-20 - Token contract for fungible assets.
* ERC-721 - Token standard for non-fungible assets.
* ERC-1155 - Multi Token Standard to take the best from previous standards to create a fungibility-agnostic and gas-efficient token contract.
* ERC-918 - Mineable Token Standard.
* ERC-165 - Creates a standard method to publish and detect what interfaces a smart contract implements.
* ERC-725 - A standard interface for a simple proxy account.
* ERC-173 - A standard interface for ownership of contracts.

## Audits
`What is an audit?` - security focused code review; looking for reentrancy attacks, vulnerabilities, etc; it is a best effort endeavor, not a guarantee
